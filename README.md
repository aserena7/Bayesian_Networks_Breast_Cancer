# Breast Cancer Bayesian Networks 
*Machine Learning Project - Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.  
Structure Learning, Parameters Learning and Inference in R.*

## Overview
The aim of this work is focused on learning and inferencing the Bayesian Network built for the original wisconsin breast cancer dataset.  
This paper will explore the different methods to learn the strucuture and the parameters of a Bayesian Network to select the model that fits better the breast cancer data.
To learning the structure both Search+Score and Constraint-Based approach are performed. 
To learning the parameters Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Based Estimation are used. 
Once obtained the Bayesian network, exact and approximate inference are performed.
It's possible, for example, having an idea about the probability of having breast cancer before to do the biopsy to diagnostic the nature of the tumor. The inference is based on the question *"What is it the probability of having breast cancer, given the results of a mammography?"*
